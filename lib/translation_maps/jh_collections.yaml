# Map individual collection code to user-presentable location.
#
# There are a LOT of Horizon collection codes, we can't map em
# all, hard to maintain -- but used for certain special cases. 

# We had to do it for MSEL Special Collections location. Recommend
# NOT using this for anything else if you can avoid it.

# NOTE: Keys should be all lowercase, and calling procedure
# should normalize to lowercase before using this map. Horizon
# likes to be case-insensitive sometimes, need to normalize to all lowercase
# to ensure correct match.
