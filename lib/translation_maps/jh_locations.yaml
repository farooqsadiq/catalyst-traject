#JHU location's in human readable format

# Some location codes have an array as a value, with more
# than one Catalyst location to map to, when we want
# to map to a higher level location like we used to do
# with "Medical Libraries" but don't actually anymore. Mostly
# we don't do this anymore, but the feature remains. 

# Map to empty string if you explictitly don't want a location
# code to post to a facet value. Otherwise, unmapped location
# codes will show up as raw keys in Catalyst interface, this is
# intentional so we notice new ones we have to map. 

__default__:  __passthrough__
